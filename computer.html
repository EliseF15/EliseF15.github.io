  <li>Input: Information enters the computer through various input devices, such as a keyboard, mouse, microphone, or sensors. This data can be in the form of text, numbers, images, or sound.</li>
  <li>Processing: The central processing unit (CPU) is the brain of the computer. It performs arithmetic and logical operations on the input data based on instructions from programs (software). The CPU fetches instructions and data from memory, processes them, and then stores the results.</li>
  <li>Memory: A computer has two main types of memory:
    <ul>
    <li>RAM (Random Access Memory): RAM is a volatile memory that temporarily stores data and program instructions while the computer is running. It provides fast access to the CPU for active tasks.</li>
    <li>Storage: Storage devices like hard drives (HDDs) or solid-state drives (SSDs) store data and programs even when the computer is turned off. Unlike RAM, storage is non-volatile, meaning data remains intact even after power loss.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Output: After processing, the computer produces output through various output devices, such as monitors, speakers, printers, or network connections. Output can be in the form of text, graphics, audio, or any other format relevant to the task.</li>
  <li>Software: Software consists of programs or applications that provide instructions for the computer to follow. Operating systems manage hardware resources and provide a platform for software to run. Application software, like word processors, web browsers, and games, interacts with users and performs specific tasks.</li>
  <li>Algorithms: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures or sets of rules that guide the computer in solving problems or performing specific tasks. They are essential for various computations and decision-making processes.</li>
