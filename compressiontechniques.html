  <li>Lossless Compression:

    Lossless compression methods reduce the size of data without losing any information. The original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed version.
    Ideal for text, program files, and databases where data integrity is crucial.
    Common lossless compression algorithms include Run-Length Encoding (RLE), Huffman coding, Arithmetic coding, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression, ZIP, and GZIP.
  </li>
  <li>Lossy Compression:

    Lossy compression is used for multimedia data where some loss of quality is acceptable in exchange for significant reduction in file size.
    Common lossy compression techniques include:
    JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) for images.
    MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer III) for audio.
    MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group) for video.
    Video codecs like H.264, H.265 (HEVC), and VP9.
  </li>
  <li>Hybrid Compression:

    Hybrid compression methods combine both lossless and lossy techniques to strike a balance between compression ratios and quality.
    Some image formats offer both lossless and lossy compression options.
  </li>
  <li>Dictionary-Based Compression:

    These techniques create a dictionary of frequently occurring patterns in the data and then represent the data using references to dictionary entries.
    For example, Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) compression used in formats like GIF.
  </li>
  <li>Transform-Based Compression:

    Transform-based methods convert data into a different domain where it can be more efficiently compressed.
    The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) used in JPEG is a well-known example.
    After compression, data is transformed back to its original domain.
  </li>
  <li>Entropy Encoding:

    Entropy encoding techniques, like Huffman coding and arithmetic coding, assign shorter codes to more frequent symbols in the data.
    Highly effective for compressing text and data with varying symbol frequencies.
