<p>RGB</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purpose: RGB is the most common color model used in electronic displays, such as computer monitors, television screens, and digital cameras.</li>
  <li>Components: It represents colors as combinations of red, green, and blue light intensities. Each component can have values ranging from 0 (minimum intensity) to 255 or 1 (maximum intensity).</li>
  <li>Representation: Colors are represented as additive combinations of these primary colors. For example, mixing red and green at full intensity produces yellow.</li>
  <li>Color Range: RGB can represent a wide gamut of colors, but it's not ideal for all color-related tasks, such as printing, because it's device-dependent.</li>
