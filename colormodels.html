<p>RGB(Red, Green, Blue)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purpose: RGB is the most common color model used in electronic displays, such as computer monitors, television screens, and digital cameras.</li>
  <li>Components: It represents colors as combinations of red, green, and blue light intensities. Each component can have values ranging from 0 (minimum intensity) to 255 or 1 (maximum intensity).</li>
  <li>Representation: Colors are represented as additive combinations of these primary colors. For example, mixing red and green at full intensity produces yellow.</li>
  <li>Color Range: RGB can represent a wide gamut of colors, but it's not ideal for all color-related tasks, such as printing, because it's device-dependent.</li>
</ul>
<p>CMYK(Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/black)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Purpose: CMY is used in color printing and subtractive color mixing, while CMYK extends this model by adding a black component for improved accuracy in printing.</li>
  <li>Components: CMY represents colors by subtracting cyan, magenta, and yellow pigments from white light. CMYK adds a key (black) component to improve color reproduction and reduce ink usage.</li>
  <li>Representation: In these models, colors are created by subtracting colors from white. Mixing all colors at full intensity should theoretically produce black, but in practice, a black component is added to CMYK to produce a true black color.</li>
  <li>Color Range: CMY(K) is suitable for color printing but may not cover the full RGB gamut.</li>
